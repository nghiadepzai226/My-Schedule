# My-Schedule
I have created a schedule web application that users could select time in calendar along with upload tasks or deadlines, and finish or delete tasks, and also have an overview of their to-do-list showing on the screen. This project is simple and easy to make with just basic technologies like html, css, js, php, sql (using xampp).
